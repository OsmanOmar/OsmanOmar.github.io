          <p>CSSOMString is used to denote string data in CSSOM specifications and can refer to either DOMString or
            USVString. When a specification says CSSOMString, it depends on the browser vendors to choose whether to use
            DOMString or USVString. While browser implementations that use UTF-8 internally to represent strings in
            memory can use USVString when the specification says CSSOMString, implementations that already represent
            strings as 16-bit sequences might choose to use DOMString instead.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>CacheStorage </h3>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Comment</h3>

          <p>The ConstantSourceNode interface—part of the Web Audio API—represents an audio source (based upon
            AudioScheduledSourceNode) whose output is single unchanging value. This makes it useful for cases in which
            you need a constant value coming in from an audio source. In addition, it can be used like a constructible
            AudioParam by automating the value of its offset or by connecting another node to it; see Controlling

          <p>The ConstrainBoolean dictionary is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a Boolean
            value. You can specify an exact value which must be matched, an ideal value that should be matched if at all
            possible, and a fallback value to attempt to match once all more specific constraints have been applied.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>ConstrainDOMString</h3>
          <p>The ConstrainDOMString dictionary is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a string.

            permitted range of property values) to also support an exact value and/or an ideal value the property should
            take on. Additionally, you can specify the property's value as a simple floating-point value, in which case
            the user agent does its best to match the value once all other more stringent constraints are met.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>ConstrainULong</h3>
          <p>The ConstrainULong type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is an integral number.
            It extends the ULongRange dictionary (which provides the ability to specify a permitted range of property
            values) to also support an exact value and/or an ideal value the property should take on. In addition, you
            can specify the value as a simple long integer value, in which case the user agent does its best to match
            the value once all other more stringent constraints are met.</p>

          <h3>IDBKeyRange</h3>
          <p>A key range can be a single value or a range with upper and lower bounds or endpoints. If the key range has
            both upper and lower bounds, then it is bounded; if it has no bounds, it is unbounded. A bounded key range
            can either be open (the endpoints are excluded) or closed (the endpoints are included). To retrieve all keys
            within a certain range, you can use the following code constructs:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>IDBLocaleAwareKeyRange </h3>
          <p>The IDBLocaleAwareKeyRange interface of the IndexedDB API is a Firefox-specific version of IDBKeyRange — it
            functions in exactly the same fashion, and has the same properties and methods, but it is intended for use
            with IDBIndex objects when the original index had a locale value specified upon its creation (see
            createIndex()'s optionalParameters) — that is, it has locale aware sorting enabled.</p>

          <p>This example shows a variety of different uses of object stores, from updating the data structure with
            IDBObjectStore.createIndex&nbsp;inside an onupgradeneeded function, to adding a new item to our object store
            with IDBObjectStore.add. For a full working example, see our&nbsp;To-do Notifications&nbsp;app (view example
            live.)</p>

          <h3>IDBRequest</h3>
          <p>The request object does not initially contain any information about the result of the operation, but once
            information becomes available, an event is fired on the request, and the information becomes available
            through the properties of the IDBRequest instance.</p>

          <h3>IDBTransaction</h3>
          <p>The IDBTransaction interface of the IndexedDB API provides a static, asynchronous transaction on a database
            using event handler attributes. All reading and writing of data is done within transactions. You use
            IDBDatabase to start transactions, IDBTransaction to set the mode of the transaction (e.g. is it readonly or
            readwrite), and you access an IDBObjectStore to make a request. You can also use an IDBTransaction object to
            abort transactions.</p>

            reserve the require database objects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>The ImageData interface represents the underlying pixel data of an area of a &lt;canvas&gt; element. It is
            created using the ImageData() constructor or creator methods on the CanvasRenderingContext2D object

            described using a MediaTrackConstraints object and set using applyConstraints(), and will adhere to the
            default constraints for any properties whose constraints haven't been changed, or whose customized
